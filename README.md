the company is a small shop that sells plumbing equipment and tools 
they currently use manual system to write in and out stock and write down manually the income of money and use a calculator and money box 
non-cloud set up 
I would recommend for a till for the shop so that they could do all the calculations on it and keep track of the money on the till and not by righting it down manually 
I would also recommend that they set up a computer and scanner so that they can keep track of inventory that is leaving their store instead of doing it manually 
They would need to set up a storage room for the data base and computer to keep track of it all in shop
Cloud set up
They could have one computer in charge of having an online database connected to the till and the inventory tracker this would be cheaper to run as it would be one computer, but they could find it harder to use as it is all online and could be confusing 
I think that the non-cloud set up would be better for them because since it is a small shop, they wouldnâ€™t have too much information to process so a small low-end computer would work fine and would take up a small amount of space and would be easier to use for the workers
